feat(configure): implement project and user configuration

This commit introduces the first feature of the Go version of tracer-bullet: project and user configuration. The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and includes:

Core Features:
- Project configuration with git local config integration
- User configuration with project-specific settings
- YAML-based configuration file management
- Command-line interface with --project and --user flags

Technical Implementation:
- Modular package structure (cmd, internal/commands, internal/config, internal/utils)
- Test suite with testify and temporary directory isolation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Configuration persistence in ~/.tracer directory

Testing Coverage:
- Unit tests for both project and user configuration
- Test environment setup with git repository initialization
- Configuration file validation
- Git config verification

The implementation maintains the original shell script functionality while adding:
- Better error handling and reporting
- Type-safe configuration management
- Improved test coverage
- Modern CLI interface using cobra
