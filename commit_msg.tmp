refactor: fix linting issues and improve file permissions

This commit:
- Adds proper error handling for os.Chdir in tests
- Introduces file permission constants in utils package
- Updates file permissions to be more secure (0600 for files)
- Fixes golangci-lint configuration
- Removes deprecated linter (gomnd) in favor of mnd

These changes improve:
- Code safety with proper error handling
- Security with stricter file permissions
- Code maintainability with consistent permission constants
- Development workflow with working pre-push checks

fix: update golangci-lint configuration for CI

This commit fixes the CI build by:
- Replacing 'mnd' linter with 'gomnd' in configuration
- Keeping the same linting rules and settings
- Ensuring compatibility with GitHub Actions environment

The change addresses the CI error:
"unknown linters: 'mnd', run 'golangci-lint help linters'"
