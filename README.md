Shell script project to deal with day-by-day activities in GAP pem projects.

Installation
------------

### OS X

`pem` is built for the Mac.

### Setup

`pem` has some parts, but I've tried to simplify installation - as much as I could!

#####1 Clone down the repository:

```
http://github.gapinc.dev/pem/pem-scripts.git
```

#####2	Make the command executable:

```
chmod +x pem
```

#####3	Add the addres from where you've cloned the project to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file's PATH variable. Here's how mine looks

```
export PATH=${PATH}:/Users/guest/Projects/pem/
```

#####4 Make sure you reload your shell with

```
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Starting It Up

Open a new terminal and type the following line:

```
pem  --help
```
